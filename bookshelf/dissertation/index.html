<h2 class="unnumbered" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This work presents Catty, a formal investigation of categorical
foundations for logics and their morphisms. Rather than following a
conventional linear progression, this thesis serves as a review of the
literature and a foundational common reference for understanding logics
as coordinate objects in a categorical structure.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="motivation-and-philosophical-stance">Motivation and Philosophical
Stance</h3>
<p>The proliferation of formal logics demands a framework that captures
their structural relationships without imposing a rigid hierarchy. Catty
adopts a position of logical pluralism, where different logics are seen
as distinct computational universes, each with its own valid internal
reasoning.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="initial-logics-and-logical-plurality">Initial
Logics and Logical Plurality</h3>
<p>A core tenet of this work is the use of "initial logics" to describe
the categorized bases from which others extend. By identifying these
initial objects, we can span the space of categorizable logics through
formal morphisms that preserve or restrict logical properties.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="proofs-as-witnesses">Proofs as Witnesses</h3>
<p>Catty goes beyond descriptive documentation by providing
computational witnesses. The existence of logical structures is proven
through executable Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), commutative
diagrams, and formal ontologies. In this framework, syntactic minimality
is shown to enable greater semantic power.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="structure-of-the-reference">Structure of the
Reference</h3>
<p>This reference is organized into themes that explore the genesis,
architecture, and formalization of the logic category:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Genesis</strong>: The foundational influences ranging
from Linear Logic to Paraconsistent Reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Architecture</strong>: The geometry of the 2D lattice and
its coordinate logic-space.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Morphisms</strong>: Formal relationships of extension and
interpretation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Universes</strong>: Logics as substrates for computation,
including links to Rust and systems programming.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Witness</strong>: The implementation of the Catty DSL and
executable categorical reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Formalization</strong>: Machine-readable RDF/OWL
ontologies and knowledge graphs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integration</strong>: Connections to the broader semantic
web and proof assistants like Isabelle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Philosophy</strong>: The overarching implications of
logical pluralism and the inversion principle.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="anatomy-of-sequent-calculus">Anatomy of
Sequent Calculus</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="reflexive-axiom-schemata">Reflexive Axiom
Schemata</h3>
<p>The reflexive axiom <span class="math inline">$\frac{\Gamma, A \vdash
A}{\Gamma \vdash A}$</span> forms the foundation of sequent calculus
presentations. In LK, the reflexive axiom represents the basic identity
principle. Different substructural calculi restrict or modify this axiom
scheme, producing characteristically different logical behaviors.</p>
<p>The matrix of reflexive axiom schemata determines what structures and
operations a logic can prove. If a logic proves every reflexive axiom
scheme of a given form, it will have specific structures or operations
and a characterizing cut metarule. If a logic does not have
corresponding structures and operations, then either they’re implicit or
the logic is consistently characterized with respect to the reflexive
axiom scheme.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="cut-rules-and-sub-rule-preservation">Cut
Rules and Sub-Rule Preservation</h3>
<p>A fundamental characteristic of substructural calculi is that they
preserve cut rules such that none contradict the cut rule of LK. They
are all sub-rules of the LK cut rule. The degree of granularity requires
examining each component:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cut elimination procedures</p></li>
<li><p>Cut as a meta-rule</p></li>
<li><p>Restrictions on cut applicability</p></li>
<li><p>Relationship between cut and other structural rules</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The preservation of cut rules determines the computational complexity
and proof-theoretic properties of each substructural logic.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="structural-rules-the-logical-parameters">Structural Rules: The
Logical Parameters</h3>
<p>Structural rules serve as the primary parameters that distinguish
substructural calculi:</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="weakening-rules">Weakening Rules</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Left weakening: <span class="math inline">$\frac{\Gamma \vdash
\Delta}{\Gamma, A \vdash \Delta}$</span></p></li>
<li><p>Right weakening: <span class="math inline">$\frac{\Gamma \vdash
\Delta}{\Gamma \vdash \Delta, A}$</span></p></li>
<li><p>Their presence or absence fundamentally alters the logic’s
character</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="contraction-rules">Contraction Rules</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Left contraction: <span class="math inline">$\frac{\Gamma, A, A
\vdash \Delta}{\Gamma \vdash \Delta}$</span></p></li>
<li><p>Right contraction: <span class="math inline">$\frac{\Gamma \vdash
\Delta, A, A}{\Gamma \vdash \Delta, A}$</span></p></li>
<li><p>Critical for resource-sensitive reasoning and the explosion
principle</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="exchange-rules">Exchange Rules</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Permutation of antecedent formulas</p></li>
<li><p>Permutation of succedent formulas</p></li>
<li><p>Essential for non-commutative logics</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The matrix or vectorization of logical relations between units,
axioms, rules, and operations is a key result that allows automatic
construction of various categorizable logics in relation to each
other.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="operational-rules">Operational Rules</h3>
<p>The operational rules define connectives and their
introduction/elimination:</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="multiplicative-connectives">Multiplicative
Connectives</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Tensor (<span class="math inline">⊗</span>) and par (<span
class="math inline">℘</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>Their structural rules and interactions</p></li>
<li><p>Relationship to linear logic’s resource semantics</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="additive-connectives">Additive
Connectives</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Conjunction (<span class="math inline">&amp;</span>) and
disjunction (<span class="math inline">⊕</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>Additive vs. multiplicative behavior</p></li>
<li><p>Proof-theoretic significance</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="exponential-modality">Exponential
Modality</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Of course (<span class="math inline">!</span>) and why not (<span
class="math inline">?</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>Resource management in linear logic</p></li>
<li><p>Relationship to structural rules</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="functional-incompleteness-and-classical-results">Functional
Incompleteness and Classical Results</h3>
<p>The substructural calculi exhibit classical functional
incompleteness, which is related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The inability to derive certain classical tautologies</p></li>
<li><p>Independence results between different logical
principles</p></li>
<li><p>The relationship between syntax and semantics in restricted
systems</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This functional incompleteness is not a deficiency but a feature that
enables logical pluralism Catty advocates. The relationship between
material implication and minimal logic is explored in detail by Diener
and McKubre-Jordens <span class="citation"
data-cites="diener2016classifying"></span>, who classify various forms
of material implication over minimal logic.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="from-lk-to-substructural-calculi-the-restriction-matrix">From LK to
Substructural Calculi: The Restriction Matrix</h3>
<p>Every valid substructural calculus can be characterized by its
restriction matrix relative to LK:</p>

<p>This matrix determines the computational and proof-theoretic
properties of each logic. The existence of valid substructural calculi
depends on which combinations of restrictions preserve consistency and
meaningful proof theory.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="dualization-and-asymmetry">Dualization and
Asymmetry</h3>
<p>The asymmetry between left and right structural rules (e.g., LJ vs
LDJ) produces distinct logical behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>LJ: Trivializes structural rules on the right (single
conclusion)</p></li>
<li><p>LDJ: Trivializes structural rules on the left (single
antecedent)</p></li>
<li><p>This asymmetry is fundamental to understanding the logic
space</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these asymmetries is crucial for constructing the full
categorical model of substructural logics and their relationships.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="genesis-where-catty-comes-from">Genesis —
Where Catty Comes From</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="the-resource-sensitive-revolution">The
Resource-Sensitive Revolution</h3>
<p>Classical linear logic (CLL) is a locally terminal object with
respect to intuitionistic linear logic, dual intuitionistic linear logic
or co-constructive linear logic, and monotonic linear logic. Monotonic
linear logic, defined as a sublogic of Multiplicative-Additive Linear
Logic without negation, XOR, Bicon, implication (lollipop), or
non-implication, is initial. It is possible that additive-only linear
logic is the further correct restriction as intuitionistic linear logic
defines multiplicative conjunction and dual intuitionistic linear logic
defines multiplicative disjunction.</p>
<p>Given that linear logic extends to classical logic by inclusion of
the weakening and contraction rules on left and right, the fact that
there exists an initial logic with respect to LL that is not LL entails
that the initial logic is also initial with respect to LK when LK is
fixed as the terminal logic.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="structural-rules-and-the-anatomy-of-sequents">Structural Rules and
the Anatomy of Sequents</h3>
<p>Structural rules (weakening, contraction, and exchange) serve as
logical parameters. Catty incorporates initial logics specifically
related to a sublogic of both Ardeshir and Vaezian’s U and Sambin et
al’s Basic Sequent Calculus. The existence of U entails dualizations of
U such that U and the dualizations share a common sublogic that excludes
specifically implication, provability predicates, interpretation
functions, non-implication, non-provability predicates, and
non-interpretation functions. Implication and non-implication are
extensions of the common sublogic.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="constructive-foundations-and-the-witness-principle">Constructive
Foundations and the Witness Principle</h3>
<p>The BHK interpretation and Kripke semantics are most directly
applicable to intuitionistic logic, which is one logic in the coordinate
space. We can dualize them for LDJ or co-constructive logic where we
have constructive assumptions but non-constructive consequences in proof
theoretical terms or we have non-constructive assumptions but
constructive consequences in refutation theoretical terms.</p>
<p>LDJ and co-constructive subclassical logics are more conservative in
their non-constructive proof consequences than classical logic, and this
bifurcates the non-constructive classes into at least two classes where
the anti-theorems of LDJ are a strict subset of the anti-theorems of LK.
The law of non-contradiction is independent of LDJ unlike with LK, and
LDJ invalidates double negation introduction which has consequences for
many anti-theorems that are dual to double negation elimination,
Peirce’s law, LEM, weak LEM, Tarski’s formula, and theorems that are
enumerated in detail by Diener and McKubre-Jordens (2016).</p>
<p>We are not imposing BHK and Kripke semantics on every logic; this is
not possible. Instead, we are documenting and demonstrating how such
correspondences and semantics relate to each other implicitly or
explicitly through morphisms and dualizations. Specific fragments of BHK
and Kripke semantics survive into the common sublogic, but the proper
interpretations necessarily change because the common sublogic of LJ and
LDJ has more restrictive syntax than either LJ or LDJ alone. BHK and
dual-BHK have to be intersected to get the commonality of BHK and
dual-BHK.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="refutation-as-co-constructive-operation">Refutation as
Co-Constructive Operation</h3>
<p>Using the language of James Trafford, Catty integrates some
refutations as co-constructive operations. There are non-constructive
refutations at least in LK, though if we use a version of LK that is
restricted to its polytime decidable fragment(s), then we would almost
assuredly be restricting to refutations that are co-constructive to the
corresponding constructive proofs. Catty draws from Nelson’s
constructive negation, Igor Urbas’s Dual-Intuitionistic Logic <span
class="citation" data-cites="urbas1996dual"></span>, and James
Trafford’s co-constructive logic <span class="citation"
data-cites="trafford2015coconstructive"></span>.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="the-great-unification">The Great
Unification</h3>
<p>The Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence has greatest direct affinity
with LJ and intuitionistic logic. We need to formalize an explicit dual
form, and we need to construct a commonality between the CHK
correspondence and its dual. Catty’s DSL is a computational witness of
this correspondence and its dual.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"

<p>Logics that avoid explosion (Ex Falso Quodlibet) are represented,

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="quantum-logic-and-non-distributivity">Quantum
Logic and Non-Distributivity</h3>
<p>Lq is the proper "basic quantum logic" whereas the Birkhoff-Neumann
logic is a distinct entity that is A quantum logic but not THE quantum
logic, and it is more semi-classical than properly quantum. Zizzi’s work
establishes Lq as the first logic which is substructural, many-valued
and quantum at the same time. Lq introduces:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A quantum metalanguage where metalinguistic links are quantum
correlations</p></li>
<li><p>A quantum cut rule interpreted as quantum projective
measurement</p></li>
<li><p>Quantum superpositions and entanglement as logical
connectives</p></li>
<li><p>An EPR rule allowing simultaneous proof of entangled
theorems</p></li>
<li><p>The qubit theorem as logical description of optical qubit state
preparation</p></li>

Logics</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="the-two-dimensional-lattice-structure">The
Two-Dimensional Lattice Structure</h3>
<p>The lattice is organized along two primary axes that define the
logic-space:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Horizontal Axis</strong>: Represents sequent
restrictions. It is symmetric at the origin, with single-succedent
restrictions on the right and single-antecedent restrictions on the
left.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vertical Axis</strong>: Represents structural rule
configurations (weakening, contraction, exchange).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The 2D lattice serves as a basis for the category that constitutes
the thesis.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="initial-logics">Initial Logics</h3>
<p>Catty utilizes "initial logics" as the language for categorizable
logics, avoiding namespace clashes with existing "Minimal" or "Basic"
logics. Initial logics are relative to the category in question.</p>
<p>LM serves as an initial common sublogic for variants such as LJ and
LDJ. It is related to the work of Sambin <span class="citation"
data-cites="sambin2000basic"></span> as a reduction or fragment of Basic
Logic.</p>
<p>LL serves as an initial object in substructural contexts, containing
three sub-linear logics that reflect linearized versions of foundational
basis logics (LM, LJ, and LDJ).</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="terminal-objects-and-closure">Terminal
Objects and Closure</h3>
<p>LK is the terminal logic in the category of subclassical logics.
Every logic in the category extends toward classical closure.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="geometric-and-cubic-structures">Geometric and
Cubic Structures</h3>
<p>The basis of the category can be represented as a cubic structure or
polytope, where each dimension represents the inclusion of symmetric
structural rules. This can be complexified by examining the asymmetry
between left and right structural rules (e.g., LJ vs LDJ).</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="morphisms-how-logics-relate">Morphisms — How
Logics Relate</h2>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="extension-morphisms">Extension Morphisms</h3>
<p>The addition of specific axioms is generally equivalent in the
sequent presentation to the addition of specific operations,
combinations of operations, or combinations of operations and structural
rules. This matrix or vectorization of the logical relations between
units, axioms, rules, and operations is a key result that allows
automatic construction of various categorizable logics in relation to
each other.</p>
<p>This is deeply related to the form of the reflexive axiom schemata
for sequent calculi. If a logic proves every reflexive axiom scheme of a
given form, it will have specific structures or operations and a
characterizing cut metarule. If the logic does not have the
corresponding structures and operations, then either they’re implicit or
the logic is inconsistently characterized with respect to the reflexive
axiom scheme. This is again related to the classical functional
incompleteness of the subclassical logics.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="interpretation-morphisms">Interpretation
Morphisms</h3>
<p>Given that the initial logics are closely related to or isomorphic to
logics of qubits, the embedding problems are related to the embedding of
quantum logics into classical logics and the embedding of classical
logic into intuitionistic or linear logic. Interpretation morphisms
represent these fundamental embedding relationships and their
preservation or loss of logical properties.</p>

Semantic Audit: RDF/OWL Schemas and Knowledge Graphs</h2>
<p>This chapter presents a systematic audit of RDF/OWL schemas and
knowledge graphs that support a category-theoretic model of formal
logics. We document existing semantic resources, their categorical
structures, and their applicability to representing logics as objects in
a category with morphisms representing sequent restrictions and
structural rules.</p>
<h3 id="category-theory-foundation-rdfowl-representations">Category
Theory Foundation: RDF/OWL Representations</h3>
<h4 id="dbpedia-category-theory-schema">DBPedia Category Theory
Schema</h4>
<p>DBPedia provides a comprehensive RDF representation of category
theory concepts extracted from Wikipedia. The following categories and
properties are relevant:</p>
<h5 id="core-categorical-concepts">Core Categorical Concepts</h5>
<ul>
<li><p><code>dbo:Category (mathematics)</code>: The primary concept for
mathematical categories</p></li>
<li><p><code>dbo:Category (topos theory)</code>: Specific to topoi as
categories</p></li>
<li><p><code>dbo:Functor</code>: Maps between categories with
preservation of structure</p></li>
<li><p><code>dbo:Monoid</code>: Single-object categories underlying
algebraic structures</p></li>
<li><p><code>dbo:Group</code>: Categories with invertible
morphisms</p></li>
<li><p><code>dbo:Limit (category theory)</code>: Universal constructions
(products, pullbacks, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p><code>dbo:Colimit (category theory)</code>: Dual
constructions</p></li>
<li><p><code>dbo:Adjoint functors</code>: Fundamental relationships
between categories</p></li>
<li><p><code>dbo:Natural transformation</code>: Morphisms between
functors</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="key-properties">Key Properties</h5>
<ul>
<li><p><code>dbo:domain</code>: Domain of a morphism or functor</p></li>
<li><p><code>dbo:codomain</code>: Codomain of a morphism or
functor</p></li>
<li><p><code>dbo:morphism</code>: Composition structure</p></li>
<li><p><code>dbo:object</code>: Objects in a category</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: DBPedia provides excellent coverage of
basic categorical concepts but lacks specific representations for
logics-as-objects or the two-dimensional lattice structure needed for
Catty. The schema is MIT-licensed and can be extended or referenced.</p>
<h4 id="wikidata-mathematical-ontology">Wikidata Mathematical
Ontology</h4>
<p>Wikidata provides a more structured ontology with explicit typing and
property definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Q719395</code>: Category (mathematics)
<code>wd:Q719395</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>Q864475</code>: Functor <code>wd:Q864475</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>Q1442189</code>: Natural transformation
<code>wd:Q1442189</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>Q357858</code>: Adjoint functors
<code>wd:Q357858</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Key properties for categorical relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>P155</code>: “domain” for morphisms/functors</p></li>
<li><p><code>P156</code>: “codomain” for morphisms/functors</p></li>
<li><p><code>P154</code>: “inverse element” for isomorphisms</p></li>
<li><p><code>P1552</code>: “maps to” for functors</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Wikidata’s ontology is CC0 (public
domain), making it highly compatible with Catty. However, it requires
significant extension to model logics as categorical objects with
sequent-specific properties.</p>

<li><p>Logic-specific modules for first-order logic</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Relevance</strong>: COLORE provides foundational ontology

<h4 id="foundational-ontology-of-logic-fol-ontology">Foundational
Ontology of Logic (FOL-ontology)</h4>
<p>Several academic projects have attempted to formalize logic systems
in OWL:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Logic-specific ontologies defining proof systems, inference

<li><p>Typically model logics as classes with properties (e.g.,
<code>hasStructuralRule</code>, <code>hasSequentForm</code>)</p></li>

logics as flat classes without categorical structure. However, they
provide useful property definitions that can be incorporated into
Catty’s categorical model.</p>

<h3 id="categorical-morphisms-and-structural-relevance">Categorical
Morphisms and Structural Relevance</h3>
<p>Morphisms in Catty represent the extension or interpretation of
logics. Specifically, extending a logic by adding an axiom (e.g., LEM,
LNC, Explosion) or a structural rule (e.g., Weakening, Contraction) is
formalized as a categorical morphism.</p>
<p>The presence of specific axioms is structurally linked to the
configuration of structural rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Full structural rules</strong> (LK) allow for the
validation of all classical principles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resource-sensitive rules</strong> (LL) correspond to the
absence of axioms related to cloning and erasure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sequent restrictions</strong> (LHS/RHS) directly impact
the validity of dual classical principles like LEM and LNC.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="semantic-web-integration">Semantic Web
Integration</h3>
<p>Conforming to the Semantic Web Technology Index (SWTI) criteria,
Catty integrates with the semantic web to import well-founded knowledge
and connect logics and morphisms back to the global literature. This
includes RDF/OWL standards compliance, linked open data principles, and
knowledge graph integration.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="proof-assistant-interoperability">Proof
Assistant Interoperability</h3>
<p>Connecting Catty to established provers. Isabelle is considered the
most significant among these (including Coq, Lean, and Agda) due to its
extensive library of proofs and theories, which Catty aims to make more
accessible to the semantic web.</p>

rather focuses on some definitive and widely used logics in
international and historic reasoning.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="the-inversion-principle">The Inversion

<h2 id="sec:sparql-validation-protocol">SPARQL Validation Protocol</h2>
<h3 id="framework">Framework</h3>
<p>This chapter documents the logical validity framework for SPARQL
query execution in the context of the Catty thesis. When querying
external semantic web endpoints, we must distinguish between three
distinct outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Empty results + successful execution</strong>: A
well-formed query executes without error but returns zero results. This
constitutes a <em>proof of negative</em>—demonstrating that no matching
data exists in the queried endpoint’s knowledge graph.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Runtime errors / compilation failures</strong>: A query
fails to execute due to syntax errors, type mismatches, or endpoint
issues. This indicates a <em>malformed query</em> and is considered
inconclusive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-empty results + successful execution</strong>: A
well-formed query executes without error and returns one or more
results. This constitutes a <em>constructive witness</em>—demonstrating
the existence of matching data in the queried endpoint’s knowledge
graph.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This framework aligns with model-theoretic semantics for query
languages <span class="citation"
data-cites="maclane1971categories"></span>, where query execution
provides evidence about the structure of the underlying model.</p>
<h3 id="logical-validity-framework">Logical Validity Framework</h3>
<h4 id="model-theoretic-interpretation">Model-Theoretic
Interpretation</h4>
<p>From a model-theoretic perspective, a SPARQL endpoint can be viewed
as an interpretation function <span class="math inline">ℐ</span> mapping
RDF triples to truth values. A query <span
class="math inline"><em>Q</em></span> can be interpreted as a formula
<span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em><sub><em>Q</em></sub></span> over
this interpretation. The execution of <span
class="math inline"><em>Q</em></span> against endpoint <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em></span> yields:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span
class="math inline">ℐ<sub><em>E</em></sub> ⊨ <em>ϕ</em><sub><em>Q</em></sub></span>
(satisfied): Non-empty results (constructive witness)</p></li>
<li><p><span
class="math inline">ℐ<sub><em>E</em></sub> ⊭ <em>ϕ</em><sub><em>Q</em></sub></span>
(not satisfied): Empty results (proof of negative)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em><sub><em>Q</em></sub></span>
is ill-formed: Compilation/execution error (malformed query)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This interpretation respects the Curry-Howard correspondence <span
class="citation" data-cites="curyhoward1934 howard1969formulae"></span>,
where query results serve as witnesses for the existence of certain
structures in the knowledge graph.</p>
<h4 id="outcome-categories">Outcome Categories</h4>
<h5 id="proof-of-negative">Proof of Negative</h5>
<p>When a well-formed SPARQL query executes successfully but returns
zero results, this provides constructive evidence that the queried
endpoint does not contain data matching the query pattern. This is
fundamentally different from a failed execution.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: Querying Wikidata for instances of a non-existent
class using valid SPARQL syntax returns empty results, proving that no
such instances exist in Wikidata’s knowledge graph.</p>
<h5 id="malformed-query">Malformed Query</h5>
<p>A query that fails to compile or execute due to syntax errors, prefix
declarations, or type mismatches provides no information about the
underlying data model. Such queries must be corrected before they can
serve as valid queries.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: A SPARQL query with an undefined prefix or
malformed triple pattern fails during parsing, indicating a query
formulation problem rather than a data availability issue.</p>
<h5 id="constructive-witness">Constructive Witness</h5>
<p>A well-formed query that executes successfully and returns non-empty
results provides direct evidence of the existence of matching structures
in the queried endpoint. These results can be treated as witnesses <span
class="citation" data-cites="negri2011proof"></span> for the query’s
satisfaction.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: Querying Wikidata for logic-related entities
returns a list of QIDs and labels, demonstrating that such entities
exist and are structured according to Wikidata’s ontology.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<h4 id="query-execution-protocol">Query Execution Protocol</h4>
<p>All SPARQL queries in this project are executed against external
endpoints following a strict protocol:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Query formulation using well-defined prefixes (e.g.,
<code>wd:</code>, <code>dbo:</code>) from authoritative
namespaces</p></li>
<li><p>Syntax validation ensuring well-formed SPARQL</p></li>
<li><p>Execution with appropriate HTTP headers (User-Agent,
Accept)</p></li>
<li><p>Capture of execution time and result count</p></li>
<li><p>Validation of result format (TTL for CONSTRUCT, JSON for
SELECT)</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="valid-query-examples">Valid Query Examples</h4>

<h3 id="invalid-query-patterns">Invalid Query Patterns</h3>
<h4 id="local-ontology-prefixes">Local Ontology Prefixes</h4>
<p>Queries using prefixes like <code>catty:</code> that reference
non-existent local ontologies are invalid for external endpoint queries.
Such prefixes may be used only with local RDF files, and only when those
files exist.</p>
<p><em>Invalid Example</em>:</p>
<pre><code>PREFIX catty: &lt;https://github.com/metavacua/CategoricalReasoner/ontology/&gt;

SELECT ?logic ?label
WHERE {
  ?logic a catty:Logic ;
         rdfs:label ?label .
}</code></pre>
<p>This query attempts to use a <code>catty:</code> prefix against
external endpoints where no such ontology exists. It may return empty
results (proof of negative) or fail depending on endpoint behavior, but
it serves no valid purpose against external sources.</p>
<h4 id="execution-evidence">Execution Evidence</h4>
<p>All documented queries must be actually executed against external
endpoints, with execution evidence preserved as valid TTL (for CONSTRUCT
queries) or CSV (for SELECT queries). Fabricating results or using
internal knowledge to simulate query output is strictly prohibited.</p>
<h3 id="query-quality-requirements">Query Quality Requirements</h3>
<p>Well-formed SPARQL queries in this project must satisfy the following
quality criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Syntax Validity</strong>: Query must parse and compile
without errors</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prefix Authority</strong>: All prefixes must reference
authoritative namespaces (e.g., wikidata.org, dbpedia.org,
w3.org)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Execution Success</strong>: Query must execute without
runtime errors</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Result Format</strong>: Results must be in valid TTL or
JSON format</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeout Compliance</strong>: Query execution must
complete within 60 seconds</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Queries that satisfy these criteria but return empty results are
considered valid (proof of negative). Queries that fail any criterion
are considered malformed and must be corrected.</p>
<h3 id="demonstration-results">Demonstration Results</h3>
<h4 id="wikidata-execution-results">Wikidata Execution Results</h4>
<p>Execution of the Wikidata logics query against
<code>https://query.wikidata.org/sparql</code> typically returns 10
logic-related entities with QIDs and labels. This serves as a
constructive witness that Wikidata contains structured data about formal
logics.</p>
<p>Example result structure:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11448&gt; a &lt;http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P31&gt; ;
    &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label&gt; &quot;logic&quot;@en .</code></pre>
<h4 id="dbpedia-execution-results">DBPedia Execution Results</h4>
<p>Execution of the DBPedia category theory query against
<code>https://dbpedia.org/sparql</code> typically returns 424
mathematical concepts with labels and classifications. This serves as a
constructive witness that DBPedia contains structured data about
category theory.</p>
<p>Example result structure:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category_theory&gt; a &lt;http://dbpedia.org/ontology/MathematicalConcept&gt; ;
    &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label&gt; &quot;Category theory&quot;@en .</code></pre>
<h3 id="integration-with-thesis-development">Integration with Thesis
Development</h3>
<p>The SPARQL validation protocol directly supports thesis development
by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Providing evidence-based citations from external semantic web
sources</p></li>
<li><p>Enabling verification of QID and URI references used in thesis
content</p></li>
<li><p>Supporting the extraction of authoritative definitions and
classifications</p></li>
<li><p>Facilitating the discovery of related work through structured
queries</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All SPARQL-derived content in the thesis must be traceable to actual
query executions with preserved evidence, maintaining the thesis’s
commitment to rigorous methodology <span class="citation"

<h3 id="extraction-process-evidence">Extraction Process Evidence</h3>
<p>Successful extraction of RDF data was performed using

<h3 id="encountered-difficulties-and-solutions">Encountered Difficulties
and Solutions</h3>
<h4 id="endpoint-security-and-user-agent-filtering">Endpoint Security
and User-Agent Filtering</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Issue</strong>: Initial attempts to query Wikidata
resulted in 403 Forbidden errors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cause</strong>: Wikidata requires a non-generic
<code>User-Agent</code> header that identifies the bot/script.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solution</strong>: Implemented a custom header
<code>CattyThesisAgent/1.0</code> in the <code>requests</code> call
within <code>run.py</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sparql-store-limitations-in-rdflib">SPARQL Store Limitations in
RDFLib</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Issue</strong>: The default
<code>rdflib.plugins.stores.sparqlstore.SPARQLStore</code> lacked
sufficient control over HTTP headers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solution</strong>: Rewrote <code>run.py</code> to use the
<code>requests</code> library directly for remote SPARQL execution,
allowing for precise control over <code>Accept</code> headers and
<code>User-Agent</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gigo-garbage-in-garbage-out-from-llm-generated-queries">GIGO
(Garbage In, Garbage Out) from LLM-Generated Queries</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Issue</strong>: LLMs frequently generate SPARQL queries
using incorrect prefixes or hallucinated property IDs (e.g., using
<code>dbo:Logic</code> instead of verifying the actual DBpedia
ontology).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solution</strong>: Adopting the <strong>Discovery
Pattern</strong> described in
<code>docs/dissertation/architecture/part-knowledge-hierarchy.tex</code>,
where an agent first queries the endpoint to find correct
URIs/Properties before attempting complex data extraction.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="recommendations-for-semantic-web-rag">Recommendations for
Semantic Web RAG</h3>
<h4 id="multi-step-semantic-resolution">Multi-Step Semantic
Resolution</h4>
<p>Instead of a single-shot RAG query, agents should follow a 3-step
process:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Entity Resolution</strong>: Convert natural language
terms to URIs using Search APIs (e.g.,
<code>wbsearchentities</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neighborhood Extraction</strong>: Use
<code>DESCRIBE</code> or <code>CONSTRUCT</code> queries to pull the
immediate graph neighborhood of the resolved URIs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contextual Synthesis</strong>: Provide the extracted TTL
to the LLM. TTL is superior to JSON-LD for RAG context because it is
more concise and its indentation clearly represents graph
structure.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="real-time-sparql-validation">Real-time SPARQL Validation</h4>
<p>Coding agents must be equipped with a local or remote SPARQL engine
to validate queries before including them in documentation or codebases.
This prevents the "hallucination loop" where an agent generates a query,
never runs it, and assumes it works.</p>
<h4 id="ttl-based-knowledge-injection">TTL-based Knowledge
Injection</h4>
<p>For code generation, especially in categorical logic, the formal
constraints of the domain should be injected as SHACL shapes. This
allows the agent to validate its own generated RDF artifacts against the
project’s schema before final submission.</p>
<h3 id="future-research-and-development">Future Research and
Development</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>SPARQL Query Optimization Agents</strong>: Developing
specialized agents that can take a naive "GIGO" query and optimize it
for performance and accuracy against specific endpoints.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ontology-Driven Code Generation</strong>: Using Jena
JavaPoet integration to generate Java classes directly from extracted
RDF schemas, ensuring type safety matches semantic definitions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Federated RAG</strong>: Researching how to perform RAG
across multiple federated SPARQL endpoints to synthesize knowledge that
doesn’t exist in a single repository.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="part:architecture">Architecture of Catty</h1>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="introduction-1">Introduction</h2>
<p>This part specifies the software and operational architecture of the
<strong>Catty</strong> framework. It consolidates previous
markdown-based documentation into a formal, literate programming
specification.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="knowledge-hierarchy">Knowledge Hierarchy</h2>
<p>The <strong>Catty</strong> framework adopts a strict hierarchy for
knowledge sourcing to ensure semantic integrity and avoid the common
pitfalls of LLM-based content generation.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="sourcing-priority-chain">Sourcing Priority
Chain</h3>
<p>Knowledge is consumed and validated according to the following
priority chain. We prioritize in each step open source and open science
alternatives over any closed source or proprietary sources:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Canonical systems</strong>: Primary expressions,
representations, and code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>International standards</strong>: ISO/IEC, IETF, and
other formal global specifications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community standards</strong>: De facto standards and
community-driven specifications (e.g., Wikidata, DBPedia).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Original Research</strong>: Specific innovations and
novel contributions of the Catty thesis.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="wikidata-discovery-protocol">Wikidata
Discovery Protocol</h3>
<p>To prevent the corruption of the semantic knowledge graph with
hallucinated identifiers, agents must follow the dynamic discovery
protocol.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="the-problem-hallucinated-qids">The Problem:
Hallucinated QIDs</h4>
<p>LLMs often produce plausible-looking but incorrect Wikidata QIDs. For
example, claiming "Classical Logic" is <code>Q192960</code> (which
actually refers to Baibars).</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory Rule</strong>: Never guess a QID. All QIDs must be
verified against the live Wikidata endpoint before use in the
repository.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="verification-and-discovery">Verification and
Discovery</h4>
<p>To verify a QID, use a SPARQL query. Note: When executing, extract
ONLY the SPARQL code, excluding any LaTeX environment markers:</p>
<pre class="sparql" data-language="SPARQL"><code>SELECT ?label ?description WHERE {
  wd:Q193138 rdfs:label ?label .
  wd:Q193138 schema:description ?description .
  FILTER(LANG(?label) = &quot;en&quot;)
}</code></pre>
<p>If a QID is unknown, discover it using a more efficient label-based
query. Note that Wikidata labels for mathematical concepts are typically
lowercase:</p>
<pre class="sparql" data-language="SPARQL"><code>SELECT DISTINCT ?item ?label ?description WHERE {
  ?item rdfs:label &quot;natural transformation&quot;@en .
  ?item schema:description ?description .
  FILTER(LANG(?description) = &quot;en&quot;)
}
LIMIT 5</code></pre>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="core-domain-registry">Core Domain

<p>The following verified identifiers constitute the core of the
<strong>Catty</strong> domain model:</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="the-literate-programming-paradigm">The
Literate Programming Paradigm</h2>
<p>The <strong>Catty</strong> framework is built on the principles of
literate programming, where the documentation and implementation are
inextricably linked. The primary technology stack for validation and
transformation is centered on the Java ecosystem, while Python serves as
an auxiliary orchestrator for CI/CD.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="tangle-and-weave">Tangle and Weave</h3>
<p>The <strong>Catty</strong> framework implements literate programming
through the processes of <em>tangling</em> and <em>weaving</em>, as
pioneered by Donald Knuth.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tangle</strong>: The extraction of executable logic and
code from the literate specification. In <strong>Catty</strong>, this
includes the generation of Java classes via JavaPoet and the derivation
of SHACL shapes from categorical models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weave</strong>: The generation of human-readable
documentation from the same specification. This produces the LaTeX-based
thesis and the integrated Javadoc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Planning Agent is responsible for the bidirectional extraction
process, maintaining integrity between the "tangled" logic and the
"woven" documentation, ensuring that changes in one are reflected in the
other.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="javadoc-first-implementation">JavaDoc-First
Implementation</h3>
<p>The implementation follows a <em>JavaDoc-first</em> approach. Every
component, especially those involving RDF transformation and SHACL
validation, must be documented before and during implementation. This
ensures that the technical specification is always in sync with the
code. Java records are a critical part of the JUnit and Javadoc code
generation paradigm or pattern.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="junit-first-validation">JUnit-First
Validation</h3>
<p>Consistency and correctness are enforced through a
<em>JUnit-first</em> methodology. Complex transformations between
categorical structures and their logical counterparts are verified by an
extensive suite of automated tests.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="technology-stack">Technology Stack</h3>
<p>The core logic of the <strong>Catty</strong> framework leverages the
following Java libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Apache Jena</strong>: For RDF processing, SPARQL
execution, and triple-store management.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OpenLlet</strong>: An OWL 2 DL reasoner used for
consistency checking of the core ontologies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>JavaPoet</strong>: Used for generating Java source code
from formal categorical specifications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>JUnit</strong>: The primary framework for unit testing
and automated validation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="python-auxiliary-layer">Python Auxiliary
Layer</h3>
<p>Python scripts, primarily located in <code>.catty/validation/</code>,
are used for higher-level orchestration. These scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Coordinate the execution of Java-based validation tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Perform structural checks on LaTeX documents.</p></li>
<li><p>Validate citation registry compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate with CI/CD pipelines to provide unified pass/fail
reports.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="build-and-dependency-architecture">Build and
Dependency Architecture</h2>
<p>The <strong>Catty</strong> framework employs a sophisticated build
system designed for high parallelizability and strict dependency
management. This ensures that categorical artifacts are produced in a
logically sound sequence.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="phase-based-execution">Phase-Based
Execution</h3>
<p>The build process is divided into four primary phases, as specified
in <code>.catty/phases.yaml</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Phase 0: Foundation</strong>: Initialization of the
repository structure and initial semantic web audits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase 1: Core Ontology</strong>: Construction of the
categorical schema, logic instances, morphism catalogs, and advanced
structures (lattices, Curry-Howard models).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase 2: Thesis</strong>: Generation of the LaTeX thesis
chapters and compilation of the final PDF.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase 3: Validation</strong>: Execution of the unified
validation framework across all produced artifacts.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="critical-path-analysis">Critical Path
Analysis</h3>
<p>The critical path for the <strong>Catty</strong> build system is
estimated at 400 minutes (6.7 hours) of sequential work. It is dominated
by the construction of the core ontology and the writing of complex
thesis chapters.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="parallelization-strategies">Parallelization
Strategies</h3>
<p>To optimize execution, the framework identifies multiple
parallelization opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Phase 0</strong>: Simultaneous initialization and
audit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase 1d</strong>: Parallel generation of examples, SHACL
shapes, and SPARQL queries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase 2b</strong>: Concurrent writing of parallelizable
chapters (e.g., Introduction and Audit).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase 3b</strong>: Parallel validation of ontology and
thesis artifacts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Optimized execution using maximum parallelization reduces the total
build time to approximately 260 minutes (4.3 hours), representing a 45%
reduction in duration.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="unified-website-architecture">Unified Website
Architecture</h3>
<p>The <strong>Catty</strong> framework produces a unified digital
presence rather than independent documentation sites. The build system
composes the JavaDoc technical documentation directly with the TeX-based
white paper and categorical models. This integration ensures that
high-level theoretical concepts are directly linked to their
corresponding implementation details, providing a seamless navigation
experience from mathematical definitions to executable code.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="artifact-transformation-pipeline">Artifact
Transformation Pipeline</h3>
<p>The build system coordinates the transformation of formal
specifications into multiple formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>TeX <span class="math inline">→</span> PDF</strong>:
Formal thesis compilation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>JSON-LD <span class="math inline">→</span> HTML</strong>:
Generation of documentation and web-ready categorical models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>JavaPoet <span class="math inline">→</span>
Java</strong>: Code generation for validation and transformation
tools.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="agent-roles-and-responsibilities">Agent Roles
and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>The <strong>Catty</strong> framework defines clear roles and
responsibilities for autonomous agents, ensuring that complex tasks are
executed with high fidelity to the formal specification.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="core-agent-types">Core Agent Types</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Planning Agent</strong>: Responsible for analyzing
<code>.catty/phases.yaml</code> and <code>.catty/operations.yaml</code>
to determine the optimal execution sequence and resolve
dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coding Agent</strong>: Executes the operational
instructions found in task descriptions to produce artifacts (LaTeX,
JSON-LD, Python).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Validation Agent</strong>: Executes the
<code>.catty/validation/validate.py</code> script and interprets
SHACL/JSON Schema reports to verify artifact compliance.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="operational-constraints">Operational
Constraints</h3>
<p>Agents are bound by strict operational constraints to maintain the
integrity of the thesis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Format Fidelity</strong>: Must adhere to the specified
file formats (JSON-LD, RDF, TeX, YAML).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ID Uniqueness</strong>: Must ensure all identifiers
(<code>thm-*</code>, <code>def-*</code>, <code>sec-*</code>) are
globally unique.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Citation Compliance</strong>: Must only use
pre-registered citation keys from the central registry.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deterministic Execution</strong>: Tasks must be executed
exactly as described in the operational instructions, without creative
interpretation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="runtime-specification">Runtime
Specification</h3>
<p>The <strong>Catty</strong> framework utilizes a Java-based runtime
specification to enforce model constraints and task execution protocols
through the following mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Custom Annotations</strong>: Use of
<code>@TaskDescription</code> and <code>@ModelConstraint</code> to
declaratively define agent expectations and domain boundaries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reflection API</strong>: Dynamic inspection of annotated
components at runtime to ensure compliance with the operational
model.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Generics</strong>: Type-safe agent templates that ensure
data passed between planning, coding, and validation agents adheres to
the required categorical schemas.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="error-handling-and-recovery">Error Handling
and Recovery</h3>
<p>When an agent encounters a validation failure or an unexpected state,
it must follow a structured recovery protocol:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Analyze</strong>: Read the error report from the
validation agent (e.g., SHACL violation message).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Locate</strong>: Identify the specific line and property
in the artifact causing the failure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Remediate</strong>: Update the artifact to satisfy the
formal constraint.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify</strong>: Re-run the validation suite until all
criteria evaluate to true.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the event of an irreconcilable conflict (e.g., a missing required
citation), the agent must halt execution and report the constraint
violation to the oversight system.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="the-software-development-lifecycle">The
Software Development Lifecycle</h2>
<p>The development lifecycle of the <strong>Catty</strong> framework is
a deterministic process designed to eliminate ambiguity and ensure that
every artifact meets formal acceptance criteria.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="development-workflow">Development
Workflow</h3>
<p>A standard development cycle for a single task follows an eight-step
protocol:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Ingestion</strong>: Read the task specification from
<code>operations.yaml</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Verification</strong>: Ensure all required dependencies
exist and are valid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Specification</strong>: Read the target artifact
specification (path, format, content spec, schema).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Execution</strong>: Follow the operational instructions
in the task description exactly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content Validation</strong>: Verify the artifact
satisfies its <code>content_spec</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Criteria Testing</strong>: Evaluate the boolean
acceptance criteria.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Formal Validation</strong>: Run the automated
<code>validate.py</code> script (syntax, RDF, SHACL).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Completion</strong>: Mark the task as complete and
proceed to the next node in the dependency graph.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="acceptance-criteria-philosophy">Acceptance
Criteria Philosophy</h3>
<p>Every task in the framework must have testable boolean acceptance
criteria. The framework explicitly forbids aspirational or subjective
criteria (e.g., "high quality", "comprehensive"). Instead, criteria must
be binary and verifiable:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">✓</span> <em>Testable</em>: "File
<code>src/ontology/logics-as-objects.jsonld</code> exists."</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">✓</span> <em>Testable</em>: "Contains
at least 7 logic instances."</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">✓</span> <em>Testable</em>: "Validates
against <code>logics-as-objects.shacl</code>."</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="continuous-validation">Continuous
Validation</h3>
<p>Validation is not a final step but a continuous process. Artifacts
are validated immediately upon creation or modification. The Giant
Global Graph integration means that semantic web data is validated
against live Wikidata endpoints to prevent identifier decay.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="licensing-and-open-source">Licensing and Open
Source</h3>
<p>All software components of the <strong>Catty</strong> framework are
licensed under <strong>AGPLv3</strong>, while documentation and thesis
content are licensed under <strong>CC BY-SA 4.0</strong>. This ensures
that both the categorical theoretical foundations and their software
implementations remain open and reproducible.</p>
