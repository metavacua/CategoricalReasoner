# Chapter: Asymmetric Exchange with Full Context on LHS and Single Succedent

## Scope
This chapter examines exchange in intuitionistic logic (LJ) where the LHS has full context exchange but the RHS is restricted to a single formula.

## Content

This chapter covers:
- **Full Exchange**: Exchange on LHS with single succedent restriction
- **Linear Exchange**: Exchange in linear logic contexts
- **Affine Exchange**: Exchange in affine logic
- **Relevant Exchange**: Exchange in relevant logic contexts

## Sequent Calculus Representation

In intuitionistic sequent calculus (LJ), exchange is expressed as:
- Left exchange: $\dfrac{\Gamma, A, B, \Delta \vdash C}{\Gamma, B, A, \Delta \vdash C}$
- No right exchange (RHS restricted to single formula)

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
