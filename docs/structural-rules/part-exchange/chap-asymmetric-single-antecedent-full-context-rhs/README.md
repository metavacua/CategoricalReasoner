# Chapter: Asymmetric Exchange with Single Antecedent and Full Context on RHS

## Scope
This chapter examines exchange in dual-intuitionistic logic (LDJ) where the LHS is restricted to a single formula but the RHS has full context exchange.

## Content

This chapter covers:
- **Full Exchange**: Exchange on RHS with single antecedent restriction
- **Linear Exchange**: Exchange in linear logic contexts
- **Affine Exchange**: Exchange in affine logic
- **Relevant Exchange**: Exchange in relevant logic contexts

## Sequent Calculus Representation

In dual-intuitionistic sequent calculus (LDJ), exchange is expressed as:
- No left exchange (LHS restricted to single formula)
- Right exchange: $\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash \Delta, A, B, \Sigma}{\Gamma \vdash \Delta, B, A, \Sigma}$

## Validation
