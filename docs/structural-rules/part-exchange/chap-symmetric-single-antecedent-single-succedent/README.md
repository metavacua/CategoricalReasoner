# Chapter: Symmetric Exchange with Single Antecedent and Single Succedent

## Scope
This chapter examines exchange in a sequent calculus structure related to Minimal Logic (Minimalkalkül), where both the LHS and RHS are restricted to single formulas. This structure is distinct from but structurally analogous to Johansson's Minimal Logic (1936).

## Content

This chapter covers:
- **Full Exchange**: Exchange under single-formula restrictions
- **Linear Exchange**: Exchange in linear logic contexts
- **Affine Exchange**: Exchange in affine logic
- **Relevant Exchange**: Exchange in relevant logic contexts

## Sequent Calculus Representation

In minimal logic, exchange rules apply symmetrically but with single-formula restrictions on both sides.

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
