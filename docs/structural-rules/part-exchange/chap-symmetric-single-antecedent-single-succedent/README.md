# Chapter: Symmetric Exchange with Single Antecedent and Single Succedent

## Scope
This chapter examines exchange in minimal logic where both the LHS and RHS are restricted to single formulas.

## Content

This chapter covers:
- **Full Exchange**: Exchange under single-formula restrictions
- **Linear Exchange**: Exchange in linear logic contexts
- **Affine Exchange**: Exchange in affine logic
- **Relevant Exchange**: Exchange in relevant logic contexts

## Sequent Calculus Representation

In minimal logic, exchange rules apply symmetrically but with single-formula restrictions on both sides.

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
