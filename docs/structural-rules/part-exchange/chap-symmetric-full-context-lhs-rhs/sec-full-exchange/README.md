# Section: Full Exchange

## Scope
This section covers full (classical) exchange where formulas can be reordered within sequent contexts without restriction.

## Content
- Classical exchange rule in LK sequent calculus
- Left exchange: $\dfrac{\Gamma, A, B, \Delta \vdash \Sigma}{\Gamma, B, A, \Delta \vdash \Sigma}$
- Right exchange: $\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash \Delta, A, B, \Sigma}{\Gamma \vdash \Delta, B, A, \Sigma}$
- Connection to commutativity
- Categorical semantics via symmetry isomorphisms

## References
- Gentzen's original sequent calculus formulations
- Categorical semantics of exchange via symmetry

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
