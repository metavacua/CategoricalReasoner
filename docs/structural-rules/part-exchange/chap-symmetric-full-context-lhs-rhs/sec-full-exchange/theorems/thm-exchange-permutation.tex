\begin{theorem}[Permutation Invariance via Exchange in LK]
\label{thm:exchange-perm-lk}
In classical sequent calculus LK with full exchange, if $\Gamma \vdash \Delta$ is derivable, then $\Gamma' \vdash \Delta'$ is derivable for any permutation $\Gamma'$ of $\Gamma$ and $\Delta'$ of $\Delta$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We prove by induction on derivation depth using root-first decomposition.

\textbf{Base Case:} Identity axiom.

\[
\infer[\text{Id}]{A \vdash A}{}
\]

Any permutation of $A \vdash A$ is identical, so invariance holds.

\textbf{Inductive Step:} Consider left rule application.

\[
\infer[\land L_1]{\Gamma, A \land B, \Delta \vdash \Sigma}{
    \Gamma, A, \Delta \vdash \Sigma}
\]

By induction hypothesis, $\Gamma, A, \Delta \vdash \Sigma$ is permutation invariant. Exchange rules allow permuting $A \land B$ with any formula in $\Gamma$ or $\Delta$:

\[
\infer[\text{Exchange}_L^*]{\Gamma', A \land B, \Delta' \vdash \Sigma'}{\Gamma, A \land B, \Delta \vdash \Sigma}
\]

where $\Gamma', \Delta', \Sigma'$ are permutations and Exchange$_L^*$ denotes multiple exchange applications.

\textbf{Right rules:} Symmetric argument using Exchange$_R$.

The exchange rules generate the symmetric group:
\[
\infer[\text{Exchange}_L]{\Gamma, B, A, \Delta \vdash \Sigma}{\Gamma, A, B, \Delta \vdash \Sigma}
\]

Since any permutation decomposes into adjacent transpositions, complete permutation invariance follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
In LK, exchange makes contexts behave as multisets. For ordered contexts (without exchange), see Linear Exchange and Relevant Exchange sections for non-commutative variants.
