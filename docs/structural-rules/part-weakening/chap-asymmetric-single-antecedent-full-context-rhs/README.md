# Chapter: Asymmetric Weakening with Single Antecedent and Full Context on RHS

## Scope
This chapter examines asymmetric weakening in dual-intuitionistic logic (LDJ) where the LHS is restricted to a single formula but the RHS context can be freely extended.

## Content

This chapter covers:
- **Full Weakening**: RHS weakening with single antecedent restriction
- **Linear Weakening**: Resource-sensitive weakening via exponential modality
- **Affine Weakening**: Weakening without contraction
- **Relevant Weakening**: Weakening rejected entirely

## Sequent Calculus Representation

In dual-intuitionistic sequent calculus (LDJ), asymmetric weakening is expressed as:
- No left weakening (LHS restricted to single formula)
- Right weakening: $\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash \Delta}{\Gamma \vdash \Delta, A}$

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
