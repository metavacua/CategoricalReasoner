# Section: LHS Weakening Rules

## Scope
This section covers left-hand side (antecedent) weakening rules for symmetric full context (Classical LK).

## Subsections

### Linear Weakening LHS
`subsec-linear-weakening-lhs/` - Weakening encoded in modalities (exponential)

### Affine Weakening LHS  
`subsec-affine-weakening-lhs/` - Weakening without contraction

### Full Weakening LHS
`subsec-full-weakening-lhs/` - Classical unrestricted weakening

### Relevant Weakening LHS
`subsec-relevant-weakening-lhs/` - No weakening (relevant logic)

## Structure
Each subsection contains:
- Rule definition in sequent calculus
- Proof of admissibility/derivability
- Categorical semantics
- Relationship to other variants

## Note
This section is for **symmetric full context** (Classical LK) only.
For asymmetric contexts, see corresponding chapters.
