# Section: RHS Weakening Rules

## Scope
This section covers right-hand side (succedent) weakening rules for symmetric full context (Classical LK).

## Subsections

### Linear Weakening RHS
`subsec-linear-weakening-rhs/` - Weakening encoded in modalities (exponential)

### Affine Weakening RHS
`subsec-affine-weakening-rhs/` - Weakening without contraction

### Full Weakening RHS
`subsec-full-weakening-rhs/` - Classical unrestricted weakening

### Relevant Weakening RHS
`subsec-relevant-weakening-rhs/` - No weakening (relevant logic)

## Structure
Each subsection contains:
- Rule definition in sequent calculus
- Proof of admissibility/derivability
- Categorical semantics
- Relationship to other variants

## Note
This section is for **symmetric full context** (Classical LK) only.
For asymmetric contexts, see corresponding chapters.
