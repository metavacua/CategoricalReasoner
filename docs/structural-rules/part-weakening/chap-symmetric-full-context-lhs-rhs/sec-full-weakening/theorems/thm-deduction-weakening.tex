\begin{theorem}[Deduction Theorem in Classical Sequent Calculus LK]
\label{thm:deduction-lk}
For any formulas $A$ and $B$ in classical propositional logic LK with full weakening and contraction:
\[
\Gamma, A \vdash B \quad \text{if and only if} \quad \Gamma \vdash A \rightarrow B
\]
where weakening and contraction are freely available on both sides.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We prove both directions using root-first decomposition.

$(\Rightarrow)$ Assume $\Gamma, A \vdash_{LK} B$. We construct $\Gamma \vdash_{LK} A \rightarrow B$.

\[
\infer[\rightarrow_R]{\Gamma \vdash A \rightarrow B}{
    \infer[{[W_R]}]{\Gamma, A \vdash B}{\Gamma, A \vdash B}}
\]

The derivation uses implication right rule, with weakening on the right to manage contexts.

$(\Leftarrow)$ Assume $\Gamma \vdash_{LK} A \rightarrow B$. We construct $\Gamma, A \vdash_{LK} B$.

\[
\infer[\text{Cut}]{\Gamma, A \vdash B}{
    \infer[\text{Id}]{A \vdash A}{} & 
    \infer[{[W_L]}]{\Gamma, A \rightarrow B, A \vdash B}{
        \infer[\rightarrow_L]{\Gamma, A \rightarrow B \vdash B}{
            \Gamma \vdash A, B & 
            \infer[\text{Id}]{B \vdash B}{}}}}
\]

The proof uses cut with identity axioms and structural rules available in LK.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
This theorem holds in LK with full structural rules. For substructural variants (Linear, Affine, Relevant), see the corresponding sections under Linear Weakening, Affine Weakening, and Relevant Weakening.
