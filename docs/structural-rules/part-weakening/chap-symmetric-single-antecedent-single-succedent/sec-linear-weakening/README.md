# Section: Linear Weakening

## Scope
This section covers linear weakening in the minimal logic setting with single formula contexts. This corresponds to **minimal linear logic** within the framework of *Minimalkalkül*.

## Asymmetric Weakening Rule

**CRITICAL**: In minimal linear logic with single formula contexts, the asymmetric weakening constraint applies:
- If LHS can be weakened, then RHS CANNOT be weakened
- If RHS can be weakened, then LHS CANNOT be weakened

## Exchange and Contraction Independence

**Important**: This section is ambivalent to whether Exchange or Contraction hold. We consider:
- Exchange holds (commutative) or is stripped to order logic
- Contraction holds or is rejected

## Minimal Logic Context
In the minimal logic setting with single formula contexts:
- Both LHS and RHS restricted to at most one formula
- Exponential modality $\oc A$ required for any weakening
- Maximum resource consciousness with asymmetric constraint

## Content
- Linear logic with single formula contexts
- Exponential modality required for any weakening
- Asymmetric weakening constraint applies
- Connection to minimal linear logic
