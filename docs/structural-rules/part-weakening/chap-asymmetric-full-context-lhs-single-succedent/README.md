# Chapter: Asymmetric Weakening with Full Context on LHS and Single Succedent

## Scope
This chapter examines asymmetric weakening in intuitionistic logic (LJ) where the LHS context can be freely extended but the RHS is restricted to a single formula.

## Content

This chapter covers:
- **Full Weakening**: LHS weakening with single succedent restriction
- **Linear Weakening**: Resource-sensitive weakening via exponential modality
- **Affine Weakening**: Weakening without contraction
- **Relevant Weakening**: Weakening rejected entirely

## Sequent Calculus Representation

In intuitionistic sequent calculus (LJ), asymmetric weakening is expressed as:
- Left weakening: $\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash C}{\Gamma, A \vdash C}$
- No right weakening (RHS restricted to single formula)

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
