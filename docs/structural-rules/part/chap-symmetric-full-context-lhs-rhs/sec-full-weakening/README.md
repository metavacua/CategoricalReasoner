# Section: Full Weakening

## Scope
This section covers full (classical) weakening where arbitrary formulas can be introduced into sequent contexts without restriction.

## Content
- Classical weakening rule in LK sequent calculus
- Left weakening: $\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash \Delta}{\Gamma, A \vdash \Delta}$
- Right weakening: $\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash \Delta}{\Gamma \vdash \Delta, A}$
- Connection to logical explosion (ex falso quodlibet)
- Paola Zizzi's work on absence of weakening and no erasure correspondence

## References
- Paola Zizzi's research on quantum logic and weakening
- Gentzen's original sequent calculus formulations

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
