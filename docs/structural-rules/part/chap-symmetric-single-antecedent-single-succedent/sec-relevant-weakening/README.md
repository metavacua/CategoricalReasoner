# Section: Relevant Weakening

## Scope
This section covers relevant weakening with single formula contexts on both sides, within the minimal logic (*Minimalkalkül*) framework.

## Asymmetric Weakening Rule

**CRITICAL**: In minimal relevant logic with single formula contexts, since relevant logic REJECTS weakening entirely, the asymmetric constraint means:
- LHS cannot be weakened AND RHS cannot be weakened
- Both sides must remain non-empty

## Exchange and Contraction Independence

**Important**: This section is ambivalent to whether Exchange or Contraction hold. We consider:
- Exchange holds (commutative) or is stripped to order logic
- Contraction is rejected by definition in relevant logic

## Minimal Logic Context
In the minimal logic setting with single formula contexts:
- Both LHS and RHS restricted to at most one formula
- Relevant logic: both weakening and contraction rejected
- Strictest relevance requirements

## Content
- Relevant logic with single formula contexts
- Both weakening and contraction rejected
- Strictest relevance requirements
- Minimal relevant logic characterization
