# Section: Relevant Weakening

## Scope
This section covers relevant weakening with single formula contexts on both sides, within the minimal logic (*Minimalkalkül*) framework.

## Minimal Logic Context
In the minimal logic setting with single formula contexts:
- Both LHS and RHS restricted to at most one formula
- Relevant logic: both weakening and contraction rejected
- Strictest relevance requirements

## Content
- Relevant logic with single formula contexts
- Both weakening and contraction rejected
- Strictest relevance requirements
- Minimal relevant logic characterization
