# Chapter: Symmetric Weakening with Single Antecedent and Single Succedent

## Scope
This chapter examines symmetric weakening where both the left-hand side (antecedent) and right-hand side (succedent) are restricted to single formulas. This represents the most restrictive form of weakening in sequent calculi.

## Content

This chapter covers:
- **Full Weakening**: Both LHS and RHS restricted to single formulas
- **Linear Weakening**: Resource-sensitive weakening in linear logic with restrictions
- **Affine Weakening**: Affine logic variant with single formula contexts
- **Relevant Weakening**: Relevant logic variant with single formula contexts

## Sequent Calculus Representation

In restricted sequent calculi:
- Left weakening: Restricted to single antecedent
- Right weakening: Restricted to single succedent

## Minimal Logic Character
This most restrictive form corresponds to minimal logic or the kernel of constructive logics where no structural rules beyond exchange are assumed.

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
