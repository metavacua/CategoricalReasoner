# Section: Linear Weakening

## Scope
This section covers linear weakening in the minimal logic setting with single formula contexts. This corresponds to **minimal linear logic** within the framework of *Minimalkalkül*.

## Minimal Logic Context
In the minimal logic setting with single formula contexts:
- Both LHS and RHS restricted to at most one formula
- Exponential modality $\oc A$ required for any weakening
- Maximum resource consciousness

## Content
- Linear logic with single formula contexts
- Exponential modality required for any weakening
- Connection to minimal linear logic
- Resource-aware reasoning within minimal logic framework
