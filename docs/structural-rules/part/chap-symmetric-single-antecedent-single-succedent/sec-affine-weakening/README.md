# Section: Affine Weakening

## Scope
This section covers affine weakening with single formula contexts on both sides, within the minimal logic (*Minimalkalkül*) framework.

## Asymmetric Weakening Rule

**CRITICAL**: In minimal affine logic with single formula contexts, the asymmetric weakening constraint applies:
- If LHS can be weakened, then RHS CANNOT be weakened
- If RHS can be weakened, then LHS CANNOT be weakened

## Exchange and Contraction Independence

**Important**: This section is ambivalent to whether Exchange or Contraction hold. We consider:
- Exchange holds (commutative) or is stripped to order logic
- Contraction is rejected by definition in affine logic

## Minimal Logic Context
In the minimal logic setting with single formula contexts:
- Both LHS and RHS restricted to at most one formula
- Affine logic: weakening admitted (asymmetrically), contraction rejected

## Content
- Affine logic with single formula contexts
- Weakening admitted (asymmetrically), contraction rejected
- Minimal substructural logic
- Connection to minimal affine reasoning
