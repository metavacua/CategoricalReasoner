# Section: Affine Weakening

## Scope
This section covers affine weakening with single formula contexts on both sides, within the minimal logic (*Minimalkalkül*) framework.

## Minimal Logic Context
In the minimal logic setting with single formula contexts:
- Both LHS and RHS restricted to at most one formula
- Affine logic: weakening admitted, contraction rejected

## Content
- Affine logic with single formula contexts
- Weakening admitted, contraction rejected
- Minimal substructural logic
- Connection to minimal affine reasoning
