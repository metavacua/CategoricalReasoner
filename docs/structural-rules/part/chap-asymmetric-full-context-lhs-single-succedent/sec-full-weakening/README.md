# Section: Full Weakening

## Scope
This section covers full weakening in the intuitionistic (LJ) setting where the left-hand side context can be freely extended but the right-hand side is restricted to a single formula.

## Content
- Intuitionistic weakening in LJ sequent calculus
- Left weakening: $\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash B}{\Gamma, A \vdash B}$ (unrestricted)
- Right weakening: Not available in pure LJ
- Constructive character from RHS restriction

## References
- Gentzen's LJ calculus
- Intuitionistic logic literature

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
