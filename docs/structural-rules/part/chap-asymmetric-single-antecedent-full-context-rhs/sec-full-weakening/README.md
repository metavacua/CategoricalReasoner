# Section: Full Weakening

## Scope
This section covers full weakening in the dual intuitionistic (LDJ) setting where the left-hand side is restricted to a single formula but the right-hand side can be freely extended.

## Content
- Dual intuitionistic weakening in LDJ sequent calculus
- Right weakening: $\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash B}{\Gamma \vdash B, A}$ (unrestricted)
- Left weakening: Not available in pure LDJ
- Restricted non-constructive character from LHS restriction

## References
- Gentzen's LDJ calculus
- Dual intuitionistic logic literature

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
