# Chapter: Asymmetric Weakening with Single Antecedent and Full Context on RHS

## Scope
This chapter examines asymmetric weakening where the left-hand side (antecedent) is restricted to a single formula, but the right-hand side (succedent) context can be freely extended. This corresponds to dual intuitionistic logic (LDJ).

## Content

This chapter covers:
- **Full Weakening**: Weakening allowed on RHS with single antecedent restriction
- **Linear Weakening**: Resource-sensitive weakening in linear logic interpretation
- **Affine Weakening**: Affine logic variant with single antecedent
- **Relevant Weakening**: Relevant logic variant with single antecedent

## Sequent Calculus Representation

In dual intuitionistic sequent calculus (LDJ):
- Left weakening: Not available in pure LDJ (restricted to single antecedent)
- Right weakening: $\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash B}{\Gamma \vdash B, A}$ (unrestricted)

## Non-Constructive Character
The restriction on LHS gives dual intuitionistic logic its restricted non-constructive character, contrasting with both classical logic (symmetric) and intuitionistic logic (restricted RHS).

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
