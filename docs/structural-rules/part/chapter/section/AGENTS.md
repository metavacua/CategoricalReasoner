# AGENTS.md - Section Directory

## Scope
This directory contains section-level content for the Weakening (Part I) chapter of the Structural Rules monograph.

## Core Constraints
- **Formats**: Read/write `*.md`, `*.tex`.
- **IDs**: All IDs globally unique following patterns: `sec-*`, `subsec-*`.
- **Content**: Sections provide focused treatment of specific aspects of weakening.

## Section Content Requirements
This section covers:
1. Intuitionistic weakening in LJ sequent calculus
   - Restricted on RHS (right-hand side)
   - Constructive character
2. Dual intuitionistic weakening in LDJ
   - Restricted on LHS (left-hand side)
   - Restricted non-constructive character
3. Classical weakening - unrestricted on both sides
4. Linear logic translation showing additive and multiplicative forms
5. Sub-intuitionistic and sub-dual-intuitionistic logics

## Key Theorems and Concepts
- Logical explosion principle depends on weakening
- In LFI, weakening on LHS and RHS are both involved
- Linear modalities involved in sequent calculi representations
- Paola Zizzi: absence of weakening corresponds to no erasure

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
