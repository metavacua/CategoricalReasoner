# AGENTS.md - Chapter Directory

## Scope
This directory contains chapter-level content for the Weakening (Part I) of the Structural Rules monograph.

## Core Constraints
- **Formats**: Read/write `*.md`, `*.tex`. 
- **IDs**: All IDs globally unique following patterns: `sec-*`, `subsec-*`.
- **Content**: Chapters should provide substantial development of the theme with multiple sections and subsections.

## Chapter Content Requirements
This chapter covers:
1. Weakening in intuitionistic logic (LJ) - restricted on RHS, constructive character
2. Weakening in dual intuitionistic logic (LDJ) - restricted on LHS, restricted non-constructive character
3. Classical weakening - unrestricted on both sides
4. Linear logic translation showing additive and multiplicative forms
5. Sub-intuitionistic and sub-dual-intuitionistic logics
6. Absence of weakening corresponding to quantum theorems
7. Logical explosion principle and weakening dependence

## References to Include
- Paola Zizzi's work on absence of weakening and no erasure correspondence

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
