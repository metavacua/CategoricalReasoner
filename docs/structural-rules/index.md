  This monograph examines the three fundamental structural rules of sequent calculus—Weakening, Contraction, and Exchange—and their roles in defining logics. Each rule is analyzed from proof-theoretic, model-theoretic, and categorical perspectives.

## About This Monograph {.unnumbered}

This monograph provides a focused examination of the structural rules that distinguish subclassical logics from each other. 

## Scope {.unnumbered}

We examine three fundamental structural rules:

**Weakening**
: The rule that permits the introduction of arbitrary formulas into a sequent context. Its rejection leads to relevant logics where every premise must contribute to the conclusion.

**Contraction**
: The rule that permits the identification of duplicate formulas. Its rejection leads to linear logics with resource-sensitive reasoning.

**Exchange**
: The rule that permits reordering of formulas. Its rejection leads to non-commutative logics with ordered contexts.

## Mathematical Prerequisites {.unnumbered}

Readers should be familiar with:

- Basic sequent calculus (LK and LJ)
- Proof theory fundamentals
- Elementary category theory (helpful but not required)

## Relation to the Dissertation {.unnumbered}

This monograph complements the main dissertation *Theoretical Metalinguistics* by providing detailed analysis of the structural rules that form one dimension of the categorical logic framework.
