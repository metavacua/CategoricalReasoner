# Chapter: Symmetric Contraction with Single Antecedent and Single Succedent

## Scope
This chapter examines contraction in minimal logic where both the LHS and RHS are restricted to single formulas.

## Content

This chapter covers:
- **Full Contraction**: Contraction under single-formula restrictions
- **Linear Contraction**: Resource-sensitive contraction
- **Affine Contraction**: Affine logic perspective
- **Relevant Contraction**: Relevant logic treatment

## Sequent Calculus Representation

In minimal logic, contraction rules apply symmetrically but with single-formula restrictions on both sides.

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
