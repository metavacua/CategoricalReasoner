\begin{theorem}[Contraction and Associative Resource Composition]
\label{thm:contraction-associativity}
In classical sequent calculus (LK) with full contraction, the contraction rules satisfy an associativity-like property: multiple contractions can be performed in any order with the same result, making the identification of duplicate formulas associative.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Consider a context with three occurrences of formula $A$: $\Gamma, A, A, A, \Delta$.

We show that contracting the first two, then the result with the third, equals contracting different pairs first.

Using left contraction twice:
\[
\infer[\text{C}_L]{\Gamma, A, \Delta}{\infer[\text{C}_L]{\Gamma, A, A, \Delta}{\Gamma, A, A, A, \Delta}}
\]

The associativity of contraction follows from the structural nature of the rule. Given any multiset of $n$ occurrences of $A$, repeated application of contraction yields exactly one occurrence, regardless of the order of pairwise contractions.

Formally, define $\text{contract}(\Gamma)$ as the result of applying left and right contraction maximally to $\Gamma$. Then for any $\Gamma$ with multiple formula occurrences:
\[
\text{contract}(\text{contract}(\Gamma)) = \text{contract}(\Gamma)
\]
showing that contraction is idempotent, and for different contraction sequences $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$:
\[
\sigma_1(\Gamma) = \sigma_2(\Gamma) = \text{contract}(\Gamma)
\]
demonstrating that contraction order does not affect the final result.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Contraction as Diagonal]
In categorical semantics, contraction corresponds to the diagonal map $\delta_A : A \to A \times A$. The associativity of contraction reflects the coassociativity of the comonoid structure on $A$ in a cartesian category.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Corollary]
In a cartesian closed category, every object $A$ has a canonical comonoid structure with:
\begin{align*}
\delta_A &: A \to A \times A \quad \text{(diagonal/copying)} \\
\epsilon_A &: A \to 1 \quad \text{(weakening/terminal)}
\end{align*}

The coassociativity condition states:
\[
(\delta_A \times \text{id}_A) \circ \delta_A = (\text{id}_A \times \delta_A) \circ \delta_A : A \to A \times A \times A
\]

This categorical property exactly corresponds to the associativity of contraction in logic: copying $A$ twice then copying one result equals copying $A$ then copying the result twice, with both yielding three copies of $A$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Linear Logic Without Contraction]
In linear logic, where contraction is restricted to exponential modalities $\oc A$:
\begin{itemize}
\item Only formulas marked with $\oc$ can be contracted
\item The diagonal map exists only for $\oc A$, not arbitrary $A$
\item This corresponds to the categorical structure of linear categories
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}
