# Section: Full Contraction

## Scope
This section covers full (classical) contraction where duplicate formulas can be merged within sequent contexts without restriction.

## Content
- Classical contraction rule in LK sequent calculus
- Left contraction: $\dfrac{\Gamma, A, A \vdash \Delta}{\Gamma, A \vdash \Delta}$
- Right contraction: $\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash \Delta, A, A}{\Gamma \vdash \Delta, A}$
- Connection to idempotency of entailment
- Categorical semantics via diagonal maps

## References
- Gentzen's original sequent calculus formulations
- Categorical semantics of contraction via comonoids

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
