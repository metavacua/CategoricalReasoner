# Section: Linear Contraction

## Scope
This section covers contraction controlled via exponential modality in linear logic.

## Content
- Contraction restricted to formulas marked with $\oc A$ (of course modality)
- Resource-sensitive: formulas not marked with $\oc$ cannot be duplicated
- Distinction between linear and non-linear contexts
- Dereliction and promotion rules

## References
- Girard's linear logic
- Categorical semantics via linear exponentials

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
