# Chapter: Asymmetric Contraction with Single Antecedent and Full Context on RHS

## Scope
This chapter examines contraction in dual-intuitionistic logic (LDJ) where the LHS is restricted to a single formula but the RHS has full context contraction.

## Content

This chapter covers:
- **Full Contraction**: Contraction on RHS with single antecedent restriction
- **Linear Contraction**: Resource-sensitive contraction
- **Affine Contraction**: Affine logic perspective
- **Relevant Contraction**: Relevant logic treatment

## Sequent Calculus Representation

In dual-intuitionistic sequent calculus (LDJ), contraction is expressed as:
- No left contraction (LHS restricted to single formula)
- Right contraction: $\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash \Delta, A, A}{\Gamma \vdash \Delta, A}$

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
