# Chapter: Asymmetric Contraction with Full Context on LHS and Single Succedent

## Scope
This chapter examines contraction in intuitionistic logic (LJ) where the LHS has full context contraction but the RHS is restricted to a single formula.

## Content

This chapter covers:
- **Full Contraction**: Contraction on LHS with single succedent restriction
- **Linear Contraction**: Resource-sensitive contraction
- **Affine Contraction**: Affine logic perspective
- **Relevant Contraction**: Relevant logic treatment

## Sequent Calculus Representation

In intuitionistic sequent calculus (LJ), contraction is expressed as:
- Left contraction: $\dfrac{\Gamma, A, A \vdash C}{\Gamma, A \vdash C}$
- No right contraction (RHS restricted to single formula)

## Validation
All artifacts must pass automated validation against the thesis structure schema.
