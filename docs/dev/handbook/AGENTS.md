# AGENTS.md - Repository Handbook

## Scope
The `docs/dev/handbook/` directory contains repository infrastructure documentation and architecture descriptions. This is the owner's manual for the repository.

## Content Type
This is **infrastructure documentation** - technical descriptions of the build system, development cycle, agent roles, and knowledge hierarchy. It is not part of the thesis or monograph argument.

## File Inventory
- `architecture/` - Architecture documentation directory
- `architecture-appendix.tex` - Architecture as LaTeX appendix

## Core Constraints
- **Format**: `.tex` files with potential conversion to `.md`
- **Purpose**: Reference documentation for repository maintainers
- **Content**: Technical infrastructure, not logical theory

## Relationship to Thesis
This directory documents HOW the repository works, not WHAT the thesis argues. It is analogous to a software project's README and docs, providing operational guidance.

## Validation
- Files must compile without errors
- Architecture descriptions must match actual implementation
