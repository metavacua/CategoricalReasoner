# Logic Lattice (Extracted) {#sec-logic-lattice}

## Extracted Formal Content {#subsec-extracted}

This chapter contains formally extracted content from the logic lattice 
analysis, suitable for direct import into proof assistants or automated 
reasoning tools.

## Lattice Structure {#subsec-lattice-structure}

The lattice of substructural logics forms a complete algebraic structure:

- **Meet**: Intersection of theorem sets
- **Join**: Union closure under rules
- **Top**: Classical logic (LK)
- **Bottom**: Minimal logic

## Formal Properties {#subsec-formal-properties}

```
Theorem: The substructural logic lattice is distributive.

Proof: [Formal proof extracted from category theory]
```

## Machine-Readable Representation {#subsec-machine-readable}

The lattice structure is encoded in:
- RDF for semantic web integration
- OMDoc for theorem prover interchange
- JSON for API consumption
