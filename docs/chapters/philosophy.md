# Philosophy {#sec-philosophy}

## Logical Pluralism {#subsec-pluralism}

Catty adopts a position of **logical pluralism**: the view that there are 
multiple, equally valid logics, each appropriate to different domains or 
purposes.

### Beall and Restall's Pluralism

Following Beall and Restall, we distinguish:

- **GTT**: The Generalized Tarski Thesis
- **Cases**: Different consequence relations for different cases
- **Application**: Context-dependent choice of logic

### Catty's Contribution

Catty provides:

1. A **categorical framework** for relating plural logics
2. **Computational witnesses** for each logic's validity
3. **Morphisms** showing how logics extend or restrict each other

## The Inversion Principle {#subsec-inversion}

The inversion principle, following Gentzen and Prawitz, states that the 
elimination rules for a connective are inverses of its introduction rules.

In Catty's framework, the inversion principle becomes a **categorical 
adjunction**, providing a structural account of harmony between rules.

## Implications for Mathematical Practice {#subsec-implications}

The categorical approach has implications for:

- **Foundations**: Multiple compatible foundations rather than a single hierarchy
- **Computation**: Resource-sensitive reasoning in programming
- **Quantum**: Non-classical logics for quantum phenomena
