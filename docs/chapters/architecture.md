# Architecture {#sec-architecture}

## The Geometry of the Logic Lattice {#subsec-lattice-geometry}

The Catty framework organizes logics within a two-dimensional coordinate space, 
where each logic occupies a position determined by its structural properties.

## Coordinate Logic-Space {#subsec-coordinate-space}

The logic space is parameterized by:

- **Horizontal axis**: Varying degrees of structural rule presence
- **Vertical axis**: Varying constructive vs. non-constructive character

## Modular Construction {#subsec-modular}

Logics are constructed modularly from basic components:

1. **Base logic**: The minimal initial logic
2. **Extensions**: Addition of connectives and rules
3. **Dualizations**: Mirror constructions for co-intuitionistic variants
4. **Compositions**: Combinations via categorical products and sums
