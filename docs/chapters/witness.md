# Witness {#sec-witness}

## The Catty DSL {#subsec-catty-dsl}

The Catty Domain-Specific Language (DSL) serves as a computational witness 
to the categorical structure of logics.

## Implementation Architecture {#subsec-implementation}

The DSL provides:

- Syntax for defining logics as categorical objects
- Operations for constructing morphisms
- Verification of commutative diagrams
- Export to formal ontologies

## Executable Proofs {#subsec-executable}

Proofs in the DSL are:

1. **Constructive**: Computable witnesses to logical derivations
2. **Composable**: Combined via categorical operations
3. **Verifiable**: Checked against formal specifications
