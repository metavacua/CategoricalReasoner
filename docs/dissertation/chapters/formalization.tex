\section*{Categorical Schema and Knowledge Graphs}
Formalizing category theory for logics using RDF/OWL to enable machine reasoning.

\section*{Decomposition of Rules and Axioms}
Decomposing each rule and axiom into reusable components, allowing for the just-in-time construction of arbitrary logics. This approach is directly analogous to programming language specifications or APIs.
