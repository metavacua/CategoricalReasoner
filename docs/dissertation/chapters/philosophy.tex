\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Philosophy --- What Catty Means}

\section*{Logical Pluralism}
Advocating for coordinate rather than hierarchical relationships between logics. Catty does not claim to model all possible logics, but rather focuses on some definitive and widely used logics in international and historic reasoning.

\section*{The Inversion Principle}
The central insight that syntactic minimality enables semantic power. This principle is related to model-theoretical results and theoretical findings concerning functional incompleteness and commutativity between subclassical logics and LK.

\section*{Review of Literature and Common Reference}
Positioning the thesis as a review of existing literature and a foundational common reference for categorical logic.
