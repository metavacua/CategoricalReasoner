\section*{The Logic-Universe Correspondence}
Establishing each logic as a distinct computational universe with specific tradeoffs. Catty provides the constraints necessary to construct the basis of each logic on demand.

\section*{Rust as Partial Linear Logic Implementation}
Empirical evidence of resource-sensitive reasoning in modern systems programming.

\section*{Decidability Boundaries}
Exploring tractable fragments of substructural logics, such as Light Linear Logic, and their computational implications.
