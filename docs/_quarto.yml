# Root Quarto Configuration
# This file configures the docs/ directory as a Quarto workspace
# containing multiple book projects

# Each subdirectory with its own _quarto.yml is an independent book:
# - dissertation/      : Theoretical Metalinguistics (main thesis)
# - structural-rules/  : Structural Rules monograph

# To render a specific book:
#   cd dissertation && quarto render
#   cd structural-rules && quarto render

# To render all books:
#   quarto render dissertation
#   quarto render structural-rules

project:
  type: default
  render:
    - "*/*.qmd"
    - "*/*.md"
    - "!dissertation/**"
    - "!structural-rules/**"
