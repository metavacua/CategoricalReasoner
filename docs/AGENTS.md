# AGENTS.md - Documentation Directory

## Scope

This file governs all materials under the `docs/` directory. All contents derive from and must comply with the root `AGENTS.md` constraints.

## Derivation from Root

The following constraints are derived from the root `AGENTS.md`:

- **Standards Collection**: The docs directory should have and collect relevant standards in a standards subdirectory for the repository and the development of its projects and derivatives. (Scope: Applies to docs/ directory.)
- **Language Constraint**: W3C compliant HTML5 for documentation and Java (primary ecosystem for validation and transformation) for code; tex and markup is to be derived by qualified deterministic and formally verified standard compliant tools. (Scope: docs/ uses CC BY-SA v4; src/ uses AGPLv3.)
- **License Constraint**: The repository should conform to and utilize https://reuse.software/dev/ for the dual licensing; where AGPLv3 and CC BY-SA v4 international conflict and both have standing, AGPLv3 is the more restrictive license so it prevails at the intersection.
- **Report Constraint**: Reports must be returned in semantic HTML or whatever format any tools use, and all documentation is to be contained in the docs directory with the sole exception being special files permitted for Github (e.g. README.md) and for specific tools like Maven. (Scope: Applies to all generated reports.)
- **Citation Constraint**: The Citation system and citations must conform to relevant academic and industrial standards for open science, open source, and international learned society practices; OAIS is a minimal standards compliance. The OAIS model (ISO 14721:2025) requires that information remains understandable to the Designated Community over the long term.
