TODO: derive canonical, strongly normalized, and standards from root AGENTS.md
All documentation in the docs needs to be updated, converted, or constructed as HTML5 static web pages deployable to Github Pages with embedded semantic linked data.
Documentation should be W3C standard compliant; customized behaviors are negatives and anti-patterns rather than desirable properties; we want less expressive and higher standard intersections rather than arbitrary expressive escalation or non-standard implementations.
Canonicity is high value; speed is irrelevant; this is not agile development; it is based in spec-driven, doc-driven, test-driven formally verified standards compliant and scalable development.
