# AGENTS.md - Documentation Layout

## Scope

This file governs all materials under the `docs/` directory. All contents derive from and must comply with the root `AGENTS.md` constraints.

## Derivation from Root

The following constraints are derived from the root `AGENTS.md`:

- **Formats**: Read/write `*.md`, `*.tex`, `*.yaml`, `*.py`
- **Languages**: W3C compliant HTML5 for documentation
- **Licensing**: Creative Commons BY-SA v4 international (docs directory)
- **Reports**: Must be returned in semantic HTML
- **Citations**: Conform to OAIS (ISO 14721:2025) standards
- **Standards**: Collect relevant standards in `docs/standards/` subdirectory

## Documentation Standards

- All documentation must be W3C standard compliant
- Documentation should be converted to HTML5 static web pages deployable to GitHub Pages with embedded semantic linked data
- Customized behaviors are anti-patterns; prefer less expressive and higher standard intersections
- Canonicity is high value; speed is irrelevant
- Spec-driven, doc-driven, test-driven formally verified standards compliant development

## Licensing

All contents of the `docs/` directory are licensed under the Creative Commons BY-SA v4 International license. Any contributions or modifications within `docs/` must comply with CC BY-SA v4 terms.
