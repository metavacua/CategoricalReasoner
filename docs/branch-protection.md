# Branch Protection Recommendations

The following settings are recommended for the default branch:

- Require pull requests before merging.
- Require status checks: Java build, Python tests, LaTeX build, and TeX structure validation.
- Require branches to be up to date before merging.
- Require signed commits.
- Include administrators in enforcement.
