This work builds upon foundational contributions from:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Gerhard Gentzen}, for the sequent calculus formalism (LK, LJ) that provides the canonical presentations used throughout this framework
\item \textbf{Igor Urbas}, for dual-intuitionistic logic (LDJ), establishing the symmetric counterpart to intuitionistic logic
\item \textbf{Jean-Yves Girard}, for linear logic and the insight that structural rules correspond to resource management constraints
\item \textbf{Haskell Curry, William Howard, Stephen Cole Kleene, and Joachim Lambek}, for the profound correspondence between logic, types, proofs, and programs that grounds the witness formalism
\item \textbf{Alfred Tarski, Andrzej Mostowski, and Raphael Robinson}, for the foundational work on formal theories and Robinson arithmetic
\end{itemize}

Special acknowledgment to the communities maintaining:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{DBpedia} and \textbf{Wikidata}, for structured knowledge graphs grounding logical definitions
\item \textbf{nLab}, for comprehensive categorical documentation
\item \textbf{Isabelle/AFP}, \textbf{Coq}, and \textbf{Lean}, for mechanized proof systems providing future validation targets
\end{itemize}

The semantic web components of this work leverage established standards from the W3C (OWL, RDF, SHACL) and open ontologies (OpenMath, SUMO).

This research is motivated by the need for logically rigorous foundations for quantum-safe programming languages and resource-aware computing systems.
