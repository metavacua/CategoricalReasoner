\section*{Semantic Web Integration}
Integrating with the Semantic Web Index (SWI) to import well-founded knowledge and connect logics and morphisms back to the global literature.

\section*{Proof Assistant Interoperability}
Connecting Catty to established provers. Isabelle is considered the most significant among these (including Coq, Lean, and Agda) due to its extensive library of proofs and theories, which Catty aims to make more accessible to the semantic web.
