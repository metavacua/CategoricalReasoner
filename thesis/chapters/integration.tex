\section*{Semantic Web Integration}
Conforming to the Semantic Web Technology Index (SWTI) criteria, Catty integrates with the semantic web to import well-founded knowledge and connect logics and morphisms back to the global literature. This includes RDF/OWL standards compliance, linked open data principles, and knowledge graph integration.

\section*{Proof Assistant Interoperability}
Connecting Catty to established provers. Isabelle is considered the most significant among these (including Coq, Lean, and Agda) due to its extensive library of proofs and theories, which Catty aims to make more accessible to the semantic web.
