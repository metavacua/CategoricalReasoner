\section*{The Resource-Sensitive Revolution}
Linear logic \cite{girard1987linear} establishes the computational substrate for Catty, where propositions are treated as resources. Catty's lattice begins at LL as its initial object.

\section*{Structural Rules and the Anatomy of Sequents}
Structural rules (weakening, contraction, and exchange) serve as logical parameters. While Gentzen \cite{negri2011proof} focused on LJ and LK, Catty incorporates initial logics related to Sambin's Basic Logic \cite{sambin2000basic} and the unification work of Ardeshir and Vaezian \cite{ardeshir2012unification}.

\section*{Constructive Foundations and the Witness Principle}
Following the BHK interpretation and Kripke semantics \cite{kripke1965semantical}, proofs are treated as constructions. Syntactic minimality in these foundations enables greater semantic power.

\section*{Refutation as Construction}
Catty integrates refutation as a constructive operation, drawing from Nelson's constructive negation, Igor Urbas's Dual-Intuitionistic Logic \cite{urbas1996dual}, and James Trafford's co-constructive logic \cite{trafford2015coconstructive}.

\section*{The Great Unification}
The Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence provides the three-fold equivalence between logic, type theory, and category theory. Catty's DSL is a computational witness of this correspondence.

\section*{Paraconsistent Reasoning and Philosophy}
Logics that avoid explosion (Ex Falso Quodlibet) are represented, drawing from the work of João Marcos, Priest, Restall, Walter Carnielli, and Paola Zizzi.

\section*{Quantum Logic and Non-Distributivity}
Connection to quantum foundations where distributivity may fail, based on Paola Zizzi's quantum metalanguage \cite{zizzi2010quantum} and Sambin's Basic Logic.

\section*{Category Theory as Metalanguage}
Category theory \cite{maclane1971categories, pierce1991category, lawvere1963functorial} provides the formal metalanguage for Catty's structure.
