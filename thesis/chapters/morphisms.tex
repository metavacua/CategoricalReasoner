\section*{Extension Morphisms}
Formalizing the addition of axioms (e.g., LEM, LNC, Explosion) and structural rules as categorical morphisms.

\section*{Interpretation Morphisms}
Representing interpretability and embeddings between logics (e.g., double-negation embedding of LJ into LK).

\section*{Functors Between Logic Categories}
Higher-order morphisms that map between different logical frameworks while preserving their internal structure, such as the Curry-Howard functor.
