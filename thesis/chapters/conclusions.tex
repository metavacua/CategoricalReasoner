\chapter{Conclusions}

This chapter summarizes the key contributions and presents final thoughts on the categorical framework for formal logics.

\section{Summary of Contributions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a categorical framework for modeling formal logics as objects in a category
\item Established a two-dimensional lattice structure for organizing logics
\item Extended the Curry-Howard correspondence with the witness functor
\item Created RDF/OWL schemas and knowledge graphs for categorical reasoning
\item Provided integration roadmap for external ontologies and resources
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Directions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Extend the framework to higher-order logics
\item Develop automated reasoning tools based on the categorical model
\item Create more comprehensive knowledge graphs and SPARQL queries
\item Explore applications in quantum computing and physical realizability
\end{itemize}

\section{Final Thoughts}

The logic-witness formalism provides a rigorous foundation for understanding the relationships between formal logics and their computational and physical interpretations.
