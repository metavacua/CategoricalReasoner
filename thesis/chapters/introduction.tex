\chapter{Introduction}

This chapter introduces the categorical framework for formal logics and establishes the motivation for the logic-witness formalism.

\section{Motivation}

The proliferation of formal logics demands a unified framework for understanding their relationships. Traditional approaches focus on extension and conservativity but fail to capture structural nuances.

\section{Scope}

This work focuses on categorizable logics that admit formal specification in terms of structural rule configurations and sequent form restrictions.

\section{Structure}

The thesis is organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter 2: Logical Formalism and the Category of Categorizable Logics
\item Chapter 3: Theoretical Formalism and the Two-Dimensional Lattice
\item Chapter 4: Witness Formalism and the Curry-Howard Extension
\item Chapter 5: Semantic Web Integration and Knowledge Graphs
\item Chapter 6: Roadmap and Future Directions
\item Conclusions: Summary and Final Thoughts
\end{itemize}
