\section*{The Catty DSL}
Catty is viewed as a library of functionality and relationality. The DSL provides a means to span the space from a given basis, utilizing Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and regular language representations of the category.

\section*{Commutative Diagrams as Computation}
Treating categorical diagrams as executable proofs that verify the structure of the logic-space.

\section*{Library of Relationality}
The repository contains working prototypes demonstrating the functionality of the Catty library and the toolchains necessary for tractable categorical reasoning.
