## Proof Target

**Theorem/Lemma**:

**Statement**:

```
[Formal statement of the theorem/lemma]
```

**Location in White Paper**: Chapter X, Section Y

## Proof Type

- [ ] Informal LaTeX proof
- [ ] Mechanized proof (Isabelle/HOL)
- [ ] Mechanized proof (Coq)
- [ ] Mechanized proof (Lean 4)

## Proof Sketch

Provide a high-level outline of the proof:

1.
2.
3.

## Dependencies

List theorems, lemmas, or axioms this proof relies on:

-
-

## Formalization Plan

If mechanizing, describe the formalization strategy:

- **Definitions needed**:
- **Lemmas to prove first**:
- **Tactics/proof methods**:

## Deliverables

- [ ] Proof completed (LaTeX or mechanized)
- [ ] Proof checked (compiled in proof assistant or peer-reviewed)
- [ ] Integration with thesis (if LaTeX proof)
- [ ] Documentation of proof structure (comments, annotations)
- [ ] Bibliography updated (if new references are used)

## Validation

How will this proof be validated?

- [ ] Mechanized: proof assistant accepts it
- [ ] Informal: peer review by at least one other contributor
- [ ] Integration test: thesis compiles with proof included

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Proof is complete and correct
- [ ] LaTeX or proof assistant code compiles without errors
- [ ] Cross-references to dependencies are correct
- [ ] Documentation is clear and complete
- [ ] Peer review completed (for informal proofs)
