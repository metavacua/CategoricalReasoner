# DEPRECATED

The `.catty/` operational model is **DEPRECATED** and **NON-FUNCTIONAL**.

## Status

The YAML-based operational model (operations.yaml, phases.yaml) has been removed as it did not match repository reality. The Python validation scripts are abandoned and non-functional.

## Current Approach

- Repository governance is via standard documentation (README.md, AGENTS.md)
- Validation is handled via Java-based tooling (Jena, JUnit)
- Task execution follows standard PR workflows

## Remaining Files

- `validation/` - May contain deprecated Python scripts (non-functional)

## Historical Context

This directory previously contained an experimental machine-readable operational model. It has been superseded by standard documentation practices.
