## Derivation from Root

The following constraints are derived from the root `AGENTS.md`:

- **Presumption of inconsistency**: Benchmark results must prove local finite consistency
- **Technology Stack**: Java ecosystem (Jena, OpenLlet, JavaPoet, JUnit) for benchmark execution
- **Validation**: Standard validation tools required; all benchmarks must produce reproducible results
- **Reports**: Benchmark reports must be returned in semantic HTML format
